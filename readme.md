# Copy files

**Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/js_task-guideline/blob/master/README.md) before start**

Write an app in `app.js` file, that will copy a file from one specified location to another like
Linux cp command: `cp file.txt file-copy.txt`.

- It must do nothing in case the user is trying to copy to the same location.
- The app must support only copying of files, and no additional options (flags). Plain copying of files.
- Throw an error with the console.error() command
